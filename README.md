Integration implements [TickTick Open API](https://developer.dida365.com/docs#/openapi) with support for [To-do list](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/todo/) entities and exposes it as services in Home Assistant, allowing you to manage your tasks and projects programmatically 😎

3. Add this repository in HACS and download TickTick Integration via HACS
4. In Settings → Devices & services, use the dotted menu to create new application credentials (`/config/application_credentials`). Enter the OAuth client ID and secret from the TickTick app here.
